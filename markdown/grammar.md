## Introduction

Welcome to the world of olili-lan!

olili-lan is a conlang (constructed language) intended to be a small, minimalist, and easy to learn. It is not meant to be a complex, naturalistic and specific language. It has a reduced dictionary on purpose (less than 200 root words), trying to balance simplicity and communication potential.

olili-lan is mainly influenced by tokipona and ygyde, with some extra bits of English, Portuguese, South Pacific Pidgins, and Hawaiian. It is also a philosophical and abstract language, styled after the _Sapir-Whorf_ hypothesis.

## Phonology and Writing System

### Consonants

|                     | Bi labial | Labio dental | Alveolar | Dorsal |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| Nasal               | m         | n            |
| Plosive             | p         | t            | k        |
| Fricative           | v         | s z          |
| Lateral Approximant | l         |

All the consonants are pronounced like any person who speaks a Western Germanic language would expect them to be, so if you are familiar with English or Dutch this should be straightforward for you.

The s is normally pronounced as /s/ when in the beginning and middle of words, and as /z/ at the end.

For those who can't read IPA symbols, the approximate pronunciation in American English is shown below:

| Letter          | IPA Symbol | American English (sound in bold) |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| k               | k          | kiss                             |
| l               | l          | let                              |
| m               | m          | him                              |
| n               | n          | month                            |
| p               | p          | pack                             |
| s               | s          | sand                             |
| s (end of word) | z          | zoo                              |
| t               | t          | tick                             |
| v               | v          | valve                            |

### Vowels

|       | Front | Back |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Close | i     |
| Mid   | ɛ     | ɔ    |
| Open  | a     |

olili-lan's vowels are quite unlike English ones. Whereas vowels in English are quite arbitrary and can be pronounced tons of different ways depending on the word, olili-lan's vowels are all regular and never change pronunciation. If you're familiar with Portuguese or Spanish, or certain other languages, especially romance ones, then your work is already cut out for you. The vowels are the same as they are pronounced when isolated in these languages.

For those who can't read IPA symbols, the approximate pronunciation in American English is shown below:

| Letter | IPA Symbol | American English (sound in bold) |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| a      | a          | hat                              |
| e      | ɛ          | bed                              |
| i      | i          | free                             |
| o      | ɔ          | thought                          |

### Writing System

All olili-lan words have no case distinctions, like Arabic, for example. This means that you do not need to use Upper Case letters even in the beginning of phrases. This doesn't mean you can't write it in Upper Case; you can, but it won"t mean anything.

olili-lan consists in the Latin alphabet, albeit using only 12 letters: 8 consonants and 4 vowels.

### Hyphen

The hyphen (**\-**) is used extensively in olili-lan. When you make compound words, the hyphen is needed between morphemes. It is also used for the plural and possessive suffixes, adverbs, negation, male and female prefixes, and the foreign words prefix, as explained in detail in section [**Affixes**](#affixes).

### Stress

Stress is always in the penult syllable. Below is a phrase in olili-lan, the transcription into IPA characters, the glossed version, and the English translation:

Stress

| koko-ako, lo pi-eko tatono anaka-s, pi-etava avila pepe-aposa. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| /ˈkɔ.kɔ-akɔ                                                    | lɔ pi ɛkɔ ta.ˈtɔ.nɔ a.ˈna.ka z | pi ɛ.ˈta.va a.ˈvi.la pɛ.pɛ a.ˈpɔ.sa/ |
| M-man, CONJ PST-have five children-PL, PST-go home now-day.    |
| The man, who had five children, went home today.               |

## Syntax

### Word Order

Sentences in olili-lan follow the common **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)** order, like English. Check the example below:

| iti | emoki | apana |
| --- | ----- | ----- |
| 2SG | eat   | food  |

This can also be easily identified by the start of the words: Since most nouns, all adjectives and all verbs have common starting letters, a simple sentence in olili-lan would have the following letters starting the 3 words: **i** **e a**

### Tenses

There are three verbal tenses in olili-lan: Past, Future, and Infinitive. For the present, use the infinitive form of the verb. For the past and the future, you need to use the prefixes **"pi-" for** the past and **"ni-"** for the future.

### Affixes

Olili-lan makes extensive use of prefixes and suffixes. These affixes modify the meaning of the word or words they are hyphenated with. Olili-lan is head final, meaning that the last word is the most important. For example, **avava-apoki**, meaning "car" or "motor vehicle", can be translated literally as "power-vehicle".

### Prefixes

|       |                                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| kaka- | Female                                         |
| koko- | Male                                           |
| pi-   | Past                                           |
| ni-   | Future                                         |
| na-   | Negation (also used as "no" when not a prefix) |
| ken-  | Question                                       |
| mi-   | Foreign Word                                   |

The **"mi-" prefix** is used preceding all foreign words, like names. The negation prefix **"na-" can** also be used isolated, but should be used as a prefix for clarity. **"ken-"** can also be used isolated " see [**Interrogative**](#interrogative).

### Suffixes

|      |                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| -s   | Plural (when following a vowel)          |
| -os  | Plural (when following a consonant)      |
| -v   | Possessive (when following a vowel)      |
| -iv  | Possessive (when following a consonant)  |
| -lem | Comparative (when following a vowel)     |
| -em  | Comparative (when following a consonant) |
| -lom | Superlative (when following a vowel)     |
| -om  | Superlative (when following a consonant) |

When pluralizing a word (except for pronouns " see [**Pronouns**](#pronouns)), use **"-s"** when following a vowel and **"-os"** when following a consonant. This can also be done with verbs and adjectives; the result would be difficult to translate to English. See the examples below:

| ili | elasa | akata  | -s  |
| --- | ----- | ------ | --- |
| 3SG | hunt  | animal | PL  |

| ili | elasa | -s  | akata  | -s  |
| --- | ----- | --- | ------ | --- |
| 3SG | hunt  | PL  | animal | PL  |

In this second case, using the plural suffix on the verb turns it into a repeated action: **"He/She hunts animals many times"**.

### Possessive

When indicating possession, you need to use the possessive suffixes on the owner"s. Use **"-v"** when following a vowel and **"-iv"** when following a consonant. See the examples below:

| akali | -v   | akalama |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| bird  | POSS | noise   |

| ilip | -iv  | alo  | -s  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| 3PL  | POSS | tool | PL  |

The phrase above translates as **"Their tools"**. Note the use of **"-iv"** following a word ending in consonant.

### Comparison

To indicate comparatives and superlatives, the respective suffixes must be used.

| olete | olete-lem | olete-lom |
| ----- | --------- | --------- |
| cold  | colder    | coldest   |

The conjunction **"pin"**, meaning "than", is also used in comparisons.

| ako    | omama | -lem | pin  | akala |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| person | big   | COMP | CONJ | fish  |

| ako    | omama | -lom |
| ------ | ----- | ---- |
| person | big   | SUPL |

The phrases above translate as **"The person is bigger than the fish"** and **"The person is the biggest"** respectively.

### Interrogative

Questions are asked by using the prefix **"ken-" on** the main verb.

| ako    | ken- | etoki | se   | ako    |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| person | Q    | speak | PREP | person |

In this example, the English translation could be **"The man asked the other man"**.

| ako    | ken- | etoki | se   | ako    |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| person | Q    | speak | PREP | person |

However,**"ken"**can also be used as a independent word, meaning can:

| ken | iti | ekama | se   | i   | -v   | avila |
| --- | --- | ----- | ---- | --- | ---- | ----- |
| Can | 2SG | come  | PREP | 1SG | POSS | home  |

The phrase above could be translated as **"Can you come to my house?"**.

### Negation

The negation word **"na"** can be used two ways: as a prefix and as an independent word.

| ako    | na- | omama |
| ------ | --- | ----- |
| person | NEG | big   |

| na  | ako    | lo  | omama |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----- |
| NEG | person | ADV | big   |

The phrases above translate as **"The person is not big"** and **"No person is this big" respectively**. Be aware that if you used the **"na"** as prefix on the second phrase, preceding the noun, then it would translate as **"Something that is not a person is this big"**.

## Vocabulary

### Pronouns

All pronouns start with **i**. Unlike English, and like many other European languages, there is a difference between you (singular) and you (plural). Check the table below.

|            | Singular | Plural |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1st Person | i        | ip     |
| 2nd Person | iti      | itip   |
| 3rd Person | ili      | ilip   |

Gender is non-existent unless specified. Should only be specified when needed. The male and female pronouns can be applied to the pronouns: For example, the literal translation of "he" is **koko-ili\*\***.\*\*

### Nouns

Nouns in olili-lan mostly start by **a**. Nouns decline indirectly according to gender and number, both through the use of suffixes.

| ip  | ako    | -s  |
| --- | ------ | --- |
| 1PL | person | PL  |

| i   | kaka- | ako    |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| 1PL | F     | person |

The phrases above can be translated as **"We are humans"** and **"I am a female"** respectively. Nouns are gender neutral by default, to infer gender use **"kaka-" and** **"koko-"**.

### Verbs

Verbs in olili-lan always start by **e**. There is a "to be" verb in olili-lan, but it is omitted in normal conversation and writing, unless it is relating to another verb. This works in a similar way to other natural languages that omit the verb "to be", like Russian.

| i   | ako    |
| --- | ------ |
| 1SG | person |

| i   | evile | eli | amama  |
| --- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1SG | want  | be  | parent |

Verbs in olili-lan don't change according to tense, you just need to add a prefix for either future or past. For the present, just leave the verb in the normal infinitive.

|     |               |
| --- | ------------- |
| pi- | Past prefix   |
| ni- | Future prefix |

|                       |                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| i eko omote amani.    | I have a lot of money.      |
| i pi-eko omote amani. | I had a lot of money.       |
| i ni-eko omote amani. | I will have a lot of money. |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in olili-lan always start by **a**. For the superlative and comparative forms, suffixes are used. For more details, see section [** Comparison**](#comparison).

### Prepositions

|      |          |
| ---- | -------- |
| se   | to       |
| sila | inside   |
| ki   | of       |
| poko | with     |
| pin  | than     |
| son  | in/at/on |
| tan  | from     |
| taso | but      |

### Colors

Olili-lan has a simple list of six core colors (**akolo\*\***\-s\*\*).

|      |        |
| ---- | ------ |
| melo | yellow |
| mako | blue   |
| maso | red    |
| mato | green  |
| valo | white  |
| vola | black  |

Other colors can be mentioned in two ways: **By addition**

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| mako-maso      | Purple |
| melo-maso      | Orange |
| melo-maso-mato | Brown  |

or **by comparison**

|               |                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| atelo-akolo   | Water color (light blue) |
| apalisa-akolo | Wood color (brown)       |
| Amono-akolo   | Moon color (white/grey)  |

### Numbers

Numbers in olili-lan "**nanepa**" are based on the body. The word for five (**tatono**) is similar to the word for hand (**atono**), while the word for twenty, related to the number of fingers in a hand. The word for twenty (**tako**) is similar to the word for person (**ako**), related to the sum of fingers and toes. The list of number-related root words is shown below.

| so     | Zero/Nothing |
| ------ | ------------ |
| ta     | One          |
| te     | Two          |
| ti     | Three        |
| to     | Four         |
| tatono | Five         |
| tako   | Twenty       |
| kili   | Hundred      |
| mili   | Thousand     |
| tili   | Million      |

To refer to other numbers, the words above must be used together, always remembering that the last word of a sequence is the most important.

| Seven                  | tatono-te        | Five-two              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Fifteen                | ti-tatono        | Three-fives           |
| Twenty-five            | tako-tatono      | Twenty-five           |
| Sixty-four             | ti-tako-to       | Three-twenties-four   |
| One hundred and eleven | kili-te-atono-ta | Hundred-two-fives-one |

### Directions

Directions are based on the cardinal points.

| amava | North - in front    |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| ameve | East - Right        |
| amivi | South - in the back |
| amovo | West - Left         |

The possessive can be used to refer to relative directions:

| ili | son  | i   | -v   | amovo     |
| --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --------- |
| 2SG | PREP | 1SG | POSS | West/left |

The phrase above could be translated as **"He is at my Left side"**.

| ili | son  | amovo     |
| --- | ---- | --------- |
| 2SG | PREP | West/left |

In this case, the phrase above could be translated as **"He is in the West"**.

### Compound Words

Since olili-lan has a small number of root words (less than 200), compound words are necessary to expose more complex concepts. In this case, as mentioned before, hyphens must be used, and the last word is the most important. **avava-apoki**, means car (power-vehicle) while **apoki-avava** means the car"s fuel (vehicle-power).
